Distance Closure on Complex Networks (Network Backbone)
=======================================================


Description
-------------

This package implements methods to calculate the Distance Closure of Complex Networks including its Metric and UltraMetric Backbone.


Installation
---------------

Latest development release on GitHub

```
pip install git+git://github.com/rionbr/distanceclosure
```

Latest PyPI stable release:

```
$pip install distanceclosure
```


Simple usage
------------

How to calculate Closure and retrieve the metric backbone of a weighted distance graph:

```python
    import networkx as nx
    import distanceclosure as dc

    # Instanciate a (weighted) graph
    edgelist = {
        ('s', 'a'): 8,
        ('s', 'c'): 6,
        ('s', 'd'): 5,
        ('a', 'd'): 2,
        ('a', 'e'): 1,
        ('b', 'e'): 6,
        ('c', 'd'): 3,
        ('c', 'f'): 9,
        ('d', 'f'): 4,
        ('e', 'g'): 4,
        ('f', 'g'): 0,
    }
    G = nx.from_edgelist(edgelist)
    # Make sure every edge has an attribute with the distance value
    nx.set_edge_attributes(G, name='distance', values=edgelist)

    # Compute closure (note this will be a fully connected graph. It can be slow for large graphs)
    C = dc.distance_closure(G, kind='metric', weight='distance')

    # You can now access the new `metric_distance` value and whether the edge is part of the metric backbone.
    C['s']['c']
    > {'distance': 6, 'metric_distance': 6, 'is_metric': True}
```

If you are only interested in the metric backbone, you might want to only include distance values for edges already in the graph.

```python
    C2 = dc.distance_closure(G, kind='metric', weight='distance', only_backbone=True)

    C.number_of_edges()
    > 22
    C2.number_of_edges()
    > 11
```
