Description:
-------------

This package implements some of the methods for the calculation of Distance Closure on Complex Networks. 
The distance closure can be calculated using different metrics. Currently supported are 'Metric' and 'Ultrametric'.

The mathematical description of the methods can be seen in:

	"T. Simas and L.M. Rocha [2015]."`Distance Closures on Complex Networks`__". *Network Science*, **3** (2):227-268. doi:10.1017/nws.2015.11"
